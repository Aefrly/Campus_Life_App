                <p>In the Caine Student Center, we have our cafeteria and this is where 
                you can find most of the students during all meal times. We have our
                own pizza oven, salad bar, sub maker, grilled foods, home foods, and pantry
                to select from.

                <h2>Mondo's Subs</h2>
                <p>In Baxter Hall, we have our own sub shop where students line up from 
                11am to 4pm to get custom made subs from some of our favorite workers 
                found on campus.

                <p>Finally, we have our own Starbucks shop in Lincoln Hall called 
                Honest Abe's Coffee. We don't have all special Starbucks items, but 
                we do have most regular menu items.
